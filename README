* Installation Instructions

First be sure that python-gudev, python-dbus, and python-gobject are
installed.

On Debian, you can install it all like so:
$ sudo apt-get install python-gudev python-dbus python-gobject

On Fedora, you can install it all like so:
$ sudo yum install python-gudev dbus-python

python-serial and python-daemon are also dependencies, but they will
be installed automagically via distutils when you install this
package.  Also, you need python-setuptools to finish the installation
process, so grab that as well.

You can install them manually on Debian like so:
$ sudo apt-get install python-serial python-daemon python-setuptools

Or on Fedora like so:
$ sudo yum install pyserial python-daemon python-setuptools

Once you have the dependencies installed, install switchprint like so
$ git clone https://github.com/Aeva/switchprint.git
$ cd switchprint
$ sudo python setup.py develop

Rather than doing "sudo python setup.py install", use the develop
version.  This will pull down any needed dependencies and setup
symlinks in various path locations to point to the relevant parts of
the repository.  Do not delete the cloned folder after running the
setup command.  Also, the "install" variant is broken currently.
