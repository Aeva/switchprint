* Installation Instructions

First be sure that python-gudev, python-dbus, and python-gobject are
installed.

On debian, you can do it like so:
$ sudo apt-get install python-gudev python-dbus python-gobject

python-serial and python-daemon are also dependencies, but they will
be installed automagically via distutils when you install this
package.

You can install them manually on debian like so:
$ sudo apt-get install python-serial python-daemon

Once you have the dependencies installed, install switchprint like so
$ git clone git@github.com:Aeva/switchprint.git
$ cd switchprint
$ sudo python setup.py install

-->  If you're planning on hacking on switchprint, do this instead:
$ sudo python setup.py develop
